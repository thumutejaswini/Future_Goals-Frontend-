<h2>MECHANICAL ENGINEERING: INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Mechanical Engineering is one of the oldest branches of Engineering. It is one of the core branches. Though this discipline has existed for a very long time, Mechanical Engineering developed into a separate branch of Engineering during the early 19th century. Industrial revolution that took place in Europe played a key role in the emergence of this branch as an independent discipline</p>

<p>Mechanical Engineering is the branch of Engineering that deals with design, manufacturing and operation of machinery. This branch uses concepts of engineering, physics and material science for design, manufacturing, operation and maintenance of mechanical systems.</p>

<p>This engineering branch touches our day to day lives directly or indirectly. From household equipment like washing machines and grinders to buses and trains that we use for transportation, mechanical engineering and machines are involved in one way or the other!</p>
