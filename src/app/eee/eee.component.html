If yes, and you are browsing about this course because you do not have much information about Diploma in Electrician course, then let me tell you that your search is over because you landed at the right place. In this article, I have tried to cover all the aspects of a diploma in electrical engineering course very well.</p>
<p>A diploma in Electrical Engineering is a 3-year junior engineering program that deals with the study of electricity and its various aspects. It is also known as a polytechnic in electrical engineering. It is one of the popular junior engineering programs that students pursue after completing their 10th and 12th classes.</p>
<p>The minimum eligibility criteria to take admission in a diploma in electrical engineering course is 10th passed or equivalent exam which must be passed by a recognized board of education. Students can also take admission after completing 12th class by qualifying for an entrance exam which is called Lateral Entry Polytechnic Examination which is conducted in every state in India by their respective state education board.</p>
<p>You can do this course from any polytechnic college that offers an electrical engineering course. In India, there are many private as well as government polytechnic colleges that offer diploma in electrical engineering courses. After completing the course, you can also get job opportunities in many industries.</p>

<h2 style="color:green;">Diploma in Electrical Engineering after 12th (Lateral Entry)
</h2>
<p>If you have passed in 12th standard then you can take direct admission in the 2nd year of the Diploma in Electrical Engineering course. For that, you have to qualify for the entrance exam which is commonly called as Lateral Entry Polytechnic Examination in a majority of the state in India. The state education board conducts the Lateral Entry Polytechnic Examination. The selection process is based on the performance in the entrance exam.</p>
<p>The majority of the polytechnic colleges in India accept admission through lateral entry. However, the percentage of seats in the lateral entry quota is less than the general entry quota. Also, You should have Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics subjects in 10+2. Basically, you should be 12th pass from the science stream.
